# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
the purpose was to show the success, failures and canceled outcomes for theater plays based on lauched date
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
First we created a pivot table based on theater outcomes vs launch
Second we created a a line chart to show successful, failed and canceled theater campaigns from the excel file
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Calculated the percentages for successful, failed and canceled campaigns based on the goal amounts and then created another line chart to show outcomes of theater plays based on the goals
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges and difficulties I encountered dealt with =countifs, I watched many different YouTube videos and examples to figure out what all went into the equation and after thinking i had something still went wrong. After reaching out to classmates I received help, got a better understanding and figured out my excel file was filtered as well
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
May is the best month to launch a successful campaign
There are more successful campaigns than failed ones
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
There were not any canceled plays
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There is no campaign cost
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
